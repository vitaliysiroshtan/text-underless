# text-underless
A css/less/sass snippet for nice links underlining.

*Work in progress*

## Why
Links should be underlined, but `text-decoration: underline` sucks.

Snippet is built using semi-transparent gradient background instead of `text-decoration: underline` or `border-bottom: 1px solid` which both produce disgusting results obtrusing descenders, tails, and loops of the lowercase letters and numerals.
